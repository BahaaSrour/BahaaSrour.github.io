Hi This is Bahaa Srour, I have worked as a software engineer for more than 5 years, I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and a Game Developer and Designer Diplomate from ITI (Information Technology Institution), I am confident that I can learn any programming language or game engine that is necessary for the job.

I am good at C#, .net, Webgl, 3D Math, GIT, creating well-structured code to build project base, Game Optimization CPU and GPU OpenGL, Shader programming HLSL, C++, Networking like photon, and integrating my work with different APIs like FireBase, ...
I am sure I would be able to fit into this position.


I have been working as a game programmer for many companies for more than 5 years now. I have a lot of published games such as Mushroom Farm around the world including China, I have established my game studio called “NT Nameless Team” We have our game almost done and we have created our demo which you can download from our Google Play, I am passionate about making video games and strive to create the best possible gaming experience for our players.
